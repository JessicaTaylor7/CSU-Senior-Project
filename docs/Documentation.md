### STATEMENT OF PURPOSE

Live Better is a personal medical manager application. This is an IOS application which provides a secure, user-friendly, 
and fully customizeable medical manager to anyone looking to improve their health and/or manage a chronic physical or mental health condition. This app gives users the ability to track symptoms, health measurements, and medications/supplements. Taking proper care of ourselves is hard, but Live Better should make things easier.

An all-in-one secure personal medical manager application should be convenient for users to track symptoms, health measurements, and medications. The application is secure, easily customizable, organized, and functions quickly and efficiently. Current symptom tracking applications, such as Bearable, CareClinic, and Symptom Tracker lack customizability, organization, and/or features such as note taking, appointment recordings, medication log, and lifestyle factors. In addition, some of these applications can be complicated and difficult for users to navigate. These shortfalls significantly reduce the number of users that can effectively use the application and therefore, miss out on the opportunity to take better control of their health.

Making modifications to the current structure of some of the well-known symptom tracking applications will allow for additional customizability and organization. Users will greatly benefit from these modifications by allowing the application to be useable for users with any one or more physical or mental health symptoms/conditions. Adding additional features will ensure users a true all-in-one medical management application, such that all symptoms, medications, and health measurements can be organized and managed in one single and convenient application. In recent years, there has been a much-needed surge of symptom tracker applications being made available to IOS users; however, these applications often fall short in customization and ease of use thereby, creating the need for an application that is fully customizable and allows users to keep all medical data and notes in one user friendly applications.
